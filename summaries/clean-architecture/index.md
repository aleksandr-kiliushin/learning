# Summary: Clean code by Robert C. Martin

## Foreword

> Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change.

System's development changes should be:

- ~~costly~~;
- ~~hard to make~~;
- ~~managed projects of their own~~;
- folded into the daily workflow.

There are a lot of paths to build the architecture:

- ðŸª¦ Architecture can be too strong and stable, born from authority and rigidity.  
  If change is expensive, change is eliminated, which causes subdued or headed of into a bureacratic ditch.  
  Totalitarism in architecture becomes a dystrophia for developers and a constant source of developers for all.
- ðŸ¤¡ Architecture can have a strong smell of speculative generality.  
  Your project becomes filled with hard-coded guesswork, countless parameters, tombs of dead code, and more complexity than your maintanance budget can allow.
- ðŸ˜Š Architecture can be maintanable and flourishing.
  - software softness is preserved as a first-class property of the system;
  - new things are discovered and created;
  - questions are asked;
  - experiments are ran.

A good architecture is ~~a destination or a frozen artifact~~ an ongoing process like a jorney or enquiry.
