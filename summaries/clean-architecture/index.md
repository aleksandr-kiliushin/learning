# Summary: Clean code by Robert C. Martin

## Foreword

System's development changes should be:

- ~~costly~~;
- ~~hard to make~~;
- ~~managed projects of their own~~;
- folded into the daily workflow.

If change is expensive, change is eliminated -- its causes subdued or headed of into a bureacratic ditch.  
Your project becomes filled with hard-coded guesswork, countless parameters, tombs of dead code, and more complexity than your maintanance budget can allow.

To keep our project mainanable and flourishing:

- we preserve software softness as a first-class property of the system;
- we create things and discover things;
- we ask questions;
- we run experiments.

A good architecture is ~~a destination or a frozen artifact~~ an ongoing process like a jorney or enquiry.
